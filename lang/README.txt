PowerEduc Language Packs

This directory contains the standard packaged PowerEduc language files,
for making the PowerEduc interface appear in different interfaces.

The default language for PowerEduc is the English language, under the
Unicode scheme (UTF8).

To add more languages to PowerEduc, you can either:

 1) use the PowerEduc languages GUI in the interface to fetch
    new languages and install them in your 'dataroot' directory.

 2) download them and unzip the packs in this directory manually
